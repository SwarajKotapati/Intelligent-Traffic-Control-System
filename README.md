Idea :

- Traffic Congestion is a serious challenge that everyone faces on daily basis.
- To tackle this issue we have devised an algorithm to efficiently distribute time to each lane
- Conventional Approach : Prioritises all lanes equally regardless of the density of vehicles present in each lane
- Devised Approach : Allocate more time to the lane which has more vehicles and vice-vera. 

To sum up the algorithm :

- To detech the number of vehicles present in each lane we have used Open CV approach to count the number of vehicles entering the lane
